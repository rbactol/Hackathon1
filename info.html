                <h3>Background</h3>
                <p>The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated education inequalities,
                    and Support Our Students (SOS) counters this growing inequality gap by bringing the Ramsey County
                    community
                    together to share resources and make sure all students can prosper.
                    Educating the next generation is the most powerful way to empower our community,
                    and we can overcome the obstacles presented by this pandemic by collaborating.
                    SOS facilitates this collaboration by employing elements of a sharing economy to match
                    underused assets and available services with students in need. Do you have an old laptop youâ€™re no
                    longer using?
                    A recommendation for a quiet coffee shop with excellent wifi? Some free hours to mentor students who
                    are struggling with algebra?
                    Discounted technology such as computers or internet hotspots? Join SOS to share these resources with
                    students in your community. </p>

                <h3>Sponsors</h3>
                <p>SOS is generously supported by [insert company name]</p>

                <h3>Website description</h3>
                <p>SOS is a crowdsourced community resource that was created in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and
                    the educational inequalities it produced. This map-based website is populated with data by users,
                    connecting available technology and information to students who lack the resources to successfully
                    adapt to online classes.</p>

                <h3>About us</h3>
                <p>SOS was created during a Hack-a-Thon organized by Hack The Gap and sponsored by Ramsey County. The
                    design of this project will allow it to expand with time as it reaches a greater audience. Success
                    will be measured by the quantity of resources shared, and we expect that this will exponentially
                    increase overtime as more community members gain access to our site. SOS seeks to add value to
                    Ramsey County by employing sustainable solutions for the community, by the community. By recycling
                    old technology and providing information on shared resources, the county will reduce waste and reep
                    the benefits of a sharing economy. Team members are Roman Bactol, Imane Chantri, Willow Fortunoff,
                    Hayley Hadges, and Isabella Valdivia.
